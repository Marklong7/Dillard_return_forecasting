# Return Forecasting  

## Description:
Utilize data science techniques with a PostgreSQL database and Python to analyze Dillard's dataset (10GB+), pinpointing the factors influencing customer returns. Employing algorithms like logistic regression, tree-models, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), we are aiming to calculate the reduction of return rates, ultimately enhancing the profit of the business. 

A meticulous Return on Investment (ROI) analysis showcases a robust ROI of 11.8%. Our strategic combination of tools and techniques promises to optimize Dillard's operations, curbing return rates and elevating overall customer experience.
