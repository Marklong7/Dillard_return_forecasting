# Return Forecasting  

## Description:
Leverage data science methodologies employing SQL and Python to analyze Dillard's dataset, uncovering the key drivers behind customer product returns. Employing logistic regression, tree-models, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms, we'll develop precise models to identify and address the root causes of returns.

The application of these data science techniques is geared towards significantly reducing the return rate, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction. Following a meticulous Return on Investment (ROI) analysis, our approach demonstrates a robust ROI of 11.8%. This signifies the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of implementing our SQL and Python-based solutions, fortified by advanced algorithms, to optimize Dillard's operations and minimize return rates.
