# Return Forecasting  

## Description:
Utilize data science techniques with a PostgreSQL database and Python to analyze Dillard's dataset (10GB+), pinpointing the factors influencing customer returns. Employing algorithms like logistic regression, tree-models, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), we'll craft models tailored to the PostgreSQL environment, enabling precise identification and mitigation of return drivers.

Our approach, centered on PostgreSQL and Python, is designed to streamline the reduction of return rates, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction. A meticulous Return on Investment (ROI) analysis showcases a robust ROI of 11.8%, emphasizing the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of implementing our PostgreSQL-based data science solutions. This strategic combination of tools and techniques promises to optimize Dillard's operations, curbing return rates and elevating overall customer experience.
